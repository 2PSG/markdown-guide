This isn't common, but some Markdown processors allow you to highlight text. The result looks <mark>like this</mark>. To highlight words, use two equal signs (`==`) before and after the words.

```text
I need to highlight these ==very important words==.
```

The HTML looks like this:

```html
I need to highlight these <mark>very important words</mark>.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

I need to highlight these <mark>very important words</mark>.
