<h1 class="page-header">Task Lists</h1>

Task lists allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes. In Markdown applications that support task lists, checkboxes will be displayed next to the content. To create a task list, add dashes (`-`) and brackets with a space (`[ ]`) in front of task list items. To select a checkbox, add an `x` in between the brackets (`[x]`).

```
- [x] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website
- [ ] Contact the media
```

The rendered output looks like this:
