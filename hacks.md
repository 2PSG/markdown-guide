## Overview

The majority of people using Markdown will find that the [basic](/basic-syntax/) and [extended syntax](/extended-syntax/) elements cover their needs. But chances are that if you use Markdown long enough, you'll inevitably discover that it doesn't support something you need. This page provides tips and tricks for working around Markdown's limitations.

  <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> <strong>Tip:</strong> These hacks aren't guaranteed to work in your Markdown application. If you need to use these things frequently, you might want to consider writing using something other than Markdown. 
</div>

## Underline

Underlined text is not something you typically see in web writing, probably because underlined text is nearly synonymous with links. However, if you're writing a paper or a report, you may need the ability to underline words and phrases. A couple applications like [Bear](/tools/bear/) and [Simplenote](/tools/simplenote/) provide support for underlining text, but Markdown doesn't natively support underlining. If your Markdown processor supports [HTML](/basic-syntax/#html), you can use the `<ins>` HTML tag to underline text in your document.

```html
Some of these words <ins>will be underlined</ins>.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

Some of these words <ins>will be underlined</ins>.

## Indent

Tabs and whitespace have a special meaning in Markdown. You can use trailing whitespace to create [line breaks](/basic-syntax/#line-breaks), and you can use tabs to create [code blocks](/basic-syntax/#code-blocks). But what if you need to indent a paragraph in a paper the old-fashioned way, using the tab key? Markdown doesn't provide an easy way of doing that. 

Your best bet might be to use a Markdown editor that supports indentation. This is common in applications that are more oriented towards desktop publishing. For example, [iA Writer](/tools/ia-writer/) allows you to customize indentation settings for the editor in the application preferences. It also provides template customization options so that you can make the rendered document look the way you expect it to, indentation and all.

Another option, if your Markdown processor supports [HTML](/basic-syntax/#html), is to use the HTML entity for non-breaking space (`&nbsp;`). This should probably be your option of last resort as it can get awkward. Basically, every `&nbsp;` in your Markdown source will be replaced with a space in the rendered output. So if you stick four instances of `&nbsp;` before a paragraph, the paragraph will look like it's indented four spaces.

```html
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first sentence of my indented paragraph.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first sentence of my indented paragraph.

## Center

Having the ability to center text is a necessity when writing a paper or a report. Unfortunately, Markdown doesn't have any concept of text alignment (one possible exception is when using [tables](/extended-syntax/#alignment)). The good news is that there's an HTML tag you can use: `<center>`. If your Markdown processor supports [HTML](/basic-syntax/#html), you can place these tags around whatever text you want to center align.

```html
<center>This text is centered.</center>
```

The rendered output looks like this:

<p style="text-align:center">This text is centered.</p>

The `<center>` HTML tag is technically supported but officially <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/center">deprecated</a>, which means it works for now but you're not supposed to be using it. Unfortunately, there's not another pure HTML alternative. You could try using one of the CSS alternatives. Not all Markdown applications provide CSS support, but if the one you're using does, here's an alternative to the `<center>` tag: 

```html
<p style="text-align:center">Center this text</p>
```

If this is supported by your Markdown application, the output looks like this:

<p style="text-align:center">Center this text</p>

## Color

Markdown doesn't allow you to change the color of text, but if your Markdown processor supports [HTML](/basic-syntax/#html), you can use the `<font>` HTML tag. The `color` attribute allows you to specify the color using a color's name or the hexadecimal `#RRGGBB` code.

```html
<font color="red">This text is red!</font>
```

The rendered output looks like this:

<p style="color:red">This text is red!</p>

The `<font>` HTML tag is technically supported but officially <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/font">deprecated</a>, which means it works for now but you're not supposed to be using it. Unfortunately, there's not another pure HTML alternative. You could try using one of the CSS alternatives. Not all Markdown applications provide CSS support, but if the one you're using does, here's an alternative to the `<font>` tag: 

```html
<p style="color:blue">Make this text blue.</p>
```

If this is supported by your Markdown application, the output looks like this:

<p style="color:blue">Make this text blue.</p>

## Comments

Some people need the ability to write sentences in their Markdown files that *will not* appear in the rendered output. These comments are essentially hidden text. The text is viewable by the author of the document, but it's not printed on the webpage or PDF. Markdown doesn't natively support comments, but several enterprising individuals have devised solutions. 

To add a comment, place text inside brackets followed by a colon, a space, and a pound sign (e.g., `[comment]: #`). You should put blank lines before and after a comment.

```text
Here's a paragraph that will be visible.

[This is a comment that will be hidden.]: # 

And here's another paragraph that's visible.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

Here's a paragraph that will be visible.

[This is a comment that will be hidden.]: # 

And here's another paragraph that's visible.

## Image Size

The Markdown syntax for [images](/basic-syntax/#images-1) doesn't allow you to specify the width and height of images. If you need to resize an image and your Markdown processor supports [HTML](/basic-syntax/#html), you can use the `img` HTML tag with the `width` and `height` attributes to set the dimensions of an image in pixels.

```html
<img src="image.png" width="200" height="100">
```

The rendered output will contain the image resized to the dimensions you specified. 

## Link Targets

Some people like creating links that open in new tabs or windows. The Markdown syntax for [links](/basic-syntax/#links) doesn't allow you to specify the `target` attribute, but if your Markdown processor supports [HTML](/basic-syntax/#html), you can use HTML to create these  links.

```html
<a href="https://www.markdownguide.org" target="_blank">Learn Markdown!</a>
```

The rendered output looks like this:

<a href="https://www.markdownguide.org" target="_blank">Learn Markdown!</a>

## Table of Contents

Some Markdown applications like [Markdeep](/tools/markdeep/) can automatically generate a table of contents (also referred to as a *toc*) from your [headings](/basic-syntax/#headings), but this isn't a feature provided by all Markdown applications. However, if your Markdown application supports [heading IDs](/extended-syntax/#heading-ids), you can create a table of contents for your Markdown file using a [list](/basic-syntax/#lists-1) and some [links](/basic-syntax/#links).

```html
#### Table of Contents

- [Underline](#underline)
- [Indent](#indent)
- [Center](#center)
- [Color](#color)
```

The rendered output looks like this:

<h4 class="no-anchor" data-toc-skip>Table of Contents</h4>

- [Underline](#underline)
- [Indent](#indent)
- [Center](#center)
- [Color](#color)

## Videos

If your Markdown application supports [HTML](/basic-syntax/#html), you should be able to embed a video in your Markdown file by copying and pasting the HTML code provided by a video website like YouTube or Vimeo. If your Markdown application doesn't support HTML, you can't embed a video, but you can come close by adding an [image](/basic-syntax/#images-1) and a link to the video. You could do this with practically any video on any video service. 

Since YouTube makes this easy, we'll use them as an example. Take this video, for instance: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q2IjQOzVpE`. The last part of the URL (`8q2IjQOzVpE`) is the ID of the video. We can take that ID and put it in the following template:

```test
[![Image alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE-ID/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE-ID)
```

YouTube automatically generates an image for every video (`https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE-ID/0.jpg`), so we can use that and [link the image](/basic-syntax/#linking-images) to the video on YouTube. After we replace the image alt text and add the ID of the video, our example looks like this:

```test
[![MxPx â€” Can't Keep Waiting](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8q2IjQOzVpE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q2IjQOzVpE)
```

The rendered output looks like this:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q2IjQOzVpE" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/8q2IjQOzVpE/0.jpg"></a>
