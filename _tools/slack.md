Slack is a popular team messaging and collaboration application that supports a limited subset of the Markdown syntax. Different parts of the interface provide different levels of Markdown support.

## Messages

Slack's messages interface is the one people use most. In its [support documentation](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#a-note-about-markdown), the company claims that the messages field at the bottom of the application window doesn't support Markdown, but that's not entirely true:

> Our message formatting was designed to support the majority of our customers. Since most are not familiar with Markdown, weâ€™ve chosen not to support it.

The messages interface fully supports the blockquotes, code, and strikethrough elements. It also partially supports the italics element using underscores only. Confusingly, the interface supports bold styling with the standard Markdown syntax for italics (single asterisks).
